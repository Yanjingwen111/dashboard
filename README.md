1. One non-flip card
   
   Uber and CEO. The location is middle.

2. Four flip cards
   
   Front: green tabs with managers' name
   
   Back: corresponding departments and managers' names
   
   The location is left-top, left-bottom, right-top and right bottom.

When you enter the homepage, you could click show button/full screen to enter full screen to have better visual experience. Otherwise the content of right-bottom corner may be missing.

Have tested that it supports Chrome(recommended), Safari, Edge, Firefox, mobile phone and Pad. Glitch does not support IE but you can open source code in zip files directly with IE.

In PC side, when your mouse move to the card, it will flip to the back which shows detail information. You do not need to click. However, if you use pad or mobile phone, you need to click screen to flip. 

In PC side, each row has 2 cards. While in the mobile side, each row will only have one card and it will be centered.

After flip card, you can use scroll bar to scroll up and down in PC side or use finger to scroll to view the content of back.

### ← style.css
Mainly used rotateY to flip card.

Have added media query to realize responsive design. The background will change into black if you use mobile to check the webpage.

### ← assets

Includes background video.
